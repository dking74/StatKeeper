                    This website was designed by StatKeeper, Inc. It was designed with the intent of allowing it's users to easily keep track of their baseball/softball teams and the corresponding stats. GameChanger is great for keeping statistics in-game, but it is incredibly cluttered and non-conducive to analyzing statistics post-game. This application gives users a better method of keeping stats and analyzing them. Enjoy!
