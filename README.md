<h1>Baseball Statkeeper</h1>
<p>
The primary purpose of this application is to allow coaches to track the statistics of their baseball teams. Inspiration for the project was drawn from lack of a good site to statically keep track of statistics.

<p>
The application allows users to create a variety of teams that they own. When the user logs in, they are brought to their team page containing a table of all the teams they own. Once clicking on a specific team, they can view the team stats, recent game stats, and player stats for the team. Users can add their statistics on a game-by-game basis.
